# Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy With Deep Learning

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

Previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. 

With photos of eyes as input, the goal of this project is to use transfer learning in Pytorch to create a model, that can be used to accurately detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy in eyes.
